# Cite-D-Lite

Cite-D-Lite version 1.0 functions on specific pages of GEO, PubMed, and DataMed.
It has two functions: (1) to create downloadable citations for GEO data and PubMed articles and (2) to highlight the most important sentences in PubMed abstracts in a graded manner (based on TextRank algorithm).

Regarding citation generation for GEO data, it generates citations for GEO datasets, GEO series, and GEO samples found on GEO. It also generates citations for GEO samples found on DataMed in addition to generating citations for PubMed articles.

Buttons to download these citations appear on 8 different types of pages:

1. Only search result listings that are either datasets, series, or samples (not platform) on the GEO search result page.
2. All GDS browser pages (which are GEO dataset-specific).
3. All GSE pages (which are GEO series-specific).
4. All GSM pages (which are GEO sample-specific).
5. Only search result listings that are GEO on the DataMed search result page.
6. All Item pages in DataMed that are GEO-specific.
7. All search result listings on the PubMed search result page.
8. All PubMed abstract pages.

The downloadable file formats are .ris, .bib, and .enw.
